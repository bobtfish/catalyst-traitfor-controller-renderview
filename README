NAME
    Catalyst::TraitFor::Controller::RenderView - Alternative to
    Catalyst::Action::RenderView using method modifiers.

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp::Controller::Root;
        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;

        BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller' }
        with 'Catalyst::TraitFor::Controller::RenderView;

DESCRIPTION
    This is an experimental alternative to Catalyst::Action::RenderView.

METHODS
  end
    Provided if not present, wrapped to run the same checks as
    Catalyst::Action::RenderView after end action.

BUGS
    The code is a horrible hack, as it delegates all the work to
    Catalyst::Action::RenderView.

    How end method attributes will compose onto other classes which already
    have an end method is unknown (they shouldn't..)

    How renaming the supplied 'end' method will work is untested at the
    moment.
