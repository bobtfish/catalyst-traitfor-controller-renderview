NAME
    Catalyst::TraitFor::Controller::RenderView - Alternative to
    Catalyst::Action::RenderView using method modifiers.

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp::Controller::Root;
        use Moose;
        use namespace::autoclean;
    
        BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller' }
        with 'CatalystX::Component::Traits';
    
        __PACKAGE__->config(
            namespace => '',
            traits => [qw/ RenderView /],
        );

DESCRIPTION
    This is an experimental alternative to Catalyst::Action::RenderView.

METHODS
  end
    Provided if not present, wrapped to run the same checks as
    Catalyst::Action::RenderView after end action.

BUGS
    Will not compose with CatalystX::Components::Traits and traits => [qw/
    RenderView /].

    The code is a horrible hack, as it delegates all the work to
    Catalyst::Action::RenderView.

    How end method attributes will compose onto other classes which already
    have an end method is unknown (they shouldn't..)
